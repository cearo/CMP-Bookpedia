This project is an implementation of a Kotlin Multiplatform (CMP) application based on the "Bookpedia" app featured in Philipp Lackner's video course. The application allows users to browse and discover books.

## About This Project

This repository contains my personal exploration and implementation of the concepts taught by Philipp Lackner. It showcases the use of Kotlin Multiplatform for building applications that share code across different targets (e.g., Android, iOS, Desktop) [2].

## Original Project & Credit

This project is heavily inspired by and based on the work of **Philipp Lackner**.

## Learning Journey

This project serves as a learning exercise in Kotlin Multiplatform development. My focus has been on understanding:

*   Shared business logic.
*   Platform-specific implementations.
*   Kotlin Multiplatform.
*   Compose Multiplatform.
*   Localization.
*   Dependency Injection with Koin.
